<h1>PROJECT WORKLIST</h1>

<hr>

<p>
A friend of mine has a sign hanging in his workshop that reads: <i>``Projects are born pregnant.''</i>  Like many projects, this book series keeps growing and evolving, reproducing itself in the form of new volumes and new chapters.  Will it ever be complete?  Probably no, but it should always be improving!
</p>

<p>
The following is a "to-do" list of work items for the book.  For each volume, work items are listed in order of my own personal priority from first to last.  Do not feel limited though, merely by what <i>I</i> think should be done first.  I'll take any help I can get!  If you think of a work item that isn't in this list, tell me and I'll include it with the rest.
</p>

<h2>All volumes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make SubML markup language XML-compliant, or else go to a different markup language entirely.</li>
<li>Add section links to top of each chapter page, to improve navigation and content display. mini-TOC now at top of each chapter of html and pdf (DC).</li>
<li>Add section links to the main index page of each volume, to improve navigation and content display.</li>
<li>Edit to improve readability of text, especially for those with limited English proficiency.</li>
<li>Convert all plain-text SPICE plot analyses to true graphic format using the <i>nutmeg</i> postprocessor utility. Mostly complete (DC).</li>
<li>Write instructions for compiling book from downloaded ".tar" archive files. README added to main directory (DC).</li>
<li>Volume 3, Semiconductors has many missing chapters and sections. Need help here</li>
</ul>

<p>
Something else I've wanted to do for each volume is to make a series of practice problems (complete with answers) for readers to test and hone their skills on.  As an electronics instructor, I've already done this for my college curriculum, but unfortunately it had to be done on school time and with school computer equipment, which means I cannot "open source" it like I can the contents of this book series.  What I'd rather <i>not</i> have is a slew of multiple-choice or numerical answer problems like so many textbooks, but rather problems engaging higher levels of thinking (synthesis and evaluation), complete with detailed answers explaining problem-solving strategies and different ways of approaching a problem.
</p>

<p>
Practice problems might be better located in a separate volume (volume VII ?) rather than at the end of every chapter, as some of the volumes are getting pretty big already.  The DC volume already exceeds 500 pages when printed on 8-1/2 x 11 paper, so I'd rather not add bulk if I don't have to.
</p>

<hr>



<h2>Volume I - DC</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write "Electric Motors" chapter.</li>
<li>Discuss strain gauge "Rosettes" and Anderson Loops in the "Electrical Instrumentation Signals" chapter (#9).</li>
<li>Discuss RTDs and Thermistors in the "Electrical Instrumentation Signals" chapter (#9).</li>
<li>Expand coverage of Magnetism (chapter 14) to include magnetic circuit calculations.</li>
<li>Include a discussion of Murray and Varley loop testing in the "DC Metering Circuits" chapter.</li>
<li>Edit section on circuit grounding in Safety chapter -- tree touching power line wire may not be best illustration of why we ground power systems.</li>
</ul>

<hr>


<h2>Volume II - AC</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write "AC Motors" chapter (#13). Completed (DC).</li>
<li>Add section(s) discussing modulation to chapter 7 (Mixed-Frequency AC Signals), including AM and FM sidebands.</li>
<li>Make "Filters" chapter (#8) more mathematically rigorous.</li>
<li>Upgrade SPICE plots in "Filters" chapter (#8) using Nutmeg graphical image output instead of plain-text output. Completed (DC).</li>
<li>Add "Scott-T" transformer discussion to Transformers chapter (#9). Completed (DC).</li>
<li>Add a section or two discussing "Smith charts" to chapter 14: "Transmission Lines"</li>
<li>Discuss balanced versus unbalanced transmission lines in chapter 14, and the operation of "balun" transformers.</li>
<li>Re-take screenshots of <i>Winscope</i> in time-domain and frequency-domain modes.  Designate the new screenshot files 22*.png, according to the naming convention for screenshot image files.</li>
</ul>

<hr>


<h2>Volume III - Semiconductors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Complete chapter 6: "Insulated-Gate Field-Effect Transistors."</li>
<li>Complete chapter 3: "Diodes and Rectifiers." Completed 2007 (DC)"</li>
<li>Complete "Practical Analog Semiconductor Circuits" chapter.  See section headings within this chapter for an idea of the content I'm planning on.  The completion of the first section ("Power supply circuits") should be top priority in this chapter.</li>
<li>Write "Active Filters" chapter (#10).</li>
<li>Write "DC Motor Drives" chapter (#11).</li>
<li>Write "Inverters and AC Motor Drives" chapter (#12).</li>
<li>Complete chapter 2: "Solid-State Device Theory."  What I'm looking for is a chapter that explains the quantum mechanisms of semiconductor devices in as much detail possible without involving calculus.  Impossible?  Perhaps, but it's worth a try!  I cringe every time I read an introductory text on semiconductors that attempts to describe electron and hole interaction in terms of classical physics . . .(TK) Completed Fall 2007. However, we need to keep up with new developments in this field (DC)</li>
<li>Complete chapter 4: "Bipolar Junction Transistors."</li>
<li>Complete chapter 5: "Junction Field-Effect Transistors."</li>
<li>Complete chapter 7: "Thyristors."  Discuss 4-quadrant firing of TRIACs.</li>
<li>Complete chapter 8: "Operational Amplifiers."  Add section on chopper-stabilization of amplifiers.</li>
<li>Expand coverage of electron tubes in chapter 13.</li>
</ul>

<hr>


<h2>Volume IV - Digital</h2>
<ul>
<li>Complete chapter 7: "Boolean Algebra."</li>
<li>Write "Combinational Logic Functions" chapter (#9). Completed by David Zizelsberger, 2007</li>
<li>Complete chapter 11: "Counters."</li>
<li>Write "Shift Registers" chapter (#12). Completed 2005.</li>
<li>Expand coverage of microprocessor architecture and function in chapter 16.</li>
<li>Expand coverage of digital memory to include more modern technology in chapter 15, especially optical and magnetic media.</li>
</ul>

<hr>


<h2>Volume V - Reference</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write a chapter on basic algebra techniques, especially equation-solving and "story problem" solving.</li>
<li>Write a chapter on oscilloscope usage.</li>
</ul>


<hr>


<h2>Volume VI - Experiments</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write new experiments for any and all chapters.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is perhaps the easiest way for someone to contribute to the book: write a short electric/electronic circuit experiment, complete with parts list, diagrams and illustrations, and instructions.  A lot less work than writing a whole chapter or chapter section!

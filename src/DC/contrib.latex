You are, of course, welcome to modify this book directly by editing your own personal copy, but we would all stand to benefit from your contributions if your ideas were incorporated into the online "master copy" where all the world can see it.
 



\section{ Credits}
 

All entries arranged in alphabetical order of surname.  Major contributions are listed by individual name with some detail on the nature of the contribution(s), date, contact info, etc.  Minor contributions (typo corrections, etc.) are listed by name only for reasons of brevity.  Please understand that when I classify a contribution as "minor," it is in no way inferior to the effort or value of a "major" contribution, just smaller in the sense of less text changed.  Any and all contributions are gratefully accepted.  I am indebted to all those who have given freely of their own knowledge, time, and resources to make this a better book!

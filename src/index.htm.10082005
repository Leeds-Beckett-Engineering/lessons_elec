<p>
Edition numbers reflect major structural changes to a book volume such
as the addition of new chapters, the substantial expansion of existing
chapters, or a change in markup language (source code formatting). I
may also increment the edition number of a volume due to the
accumulation of many smaller changes. For a volume under active
revision, one edition per year is normal.
</p>
<p>
"Last revised" dates reflect non-trivial changes only. Minor changes I
make such as typographical error correction and stylistic changes to
the text do not warrant increments to this date. New topics added to
the text, as well as any outside contributions, are the minimum change
level warranting a new revision date.

<p>
<b>Note to instructors:</b>
</p>
<p>
My commitment to those using these texts as student resources in
instructional curricula is to never delete subject matter content as
the books evolve through succeeding revisions and editions. New
subjects will be added, and existing subjects expanded in coverage, but
I will never omit "old" subjects. My experience is that even "obsolete"
subjects in electronics hold important lessons for students, and
sometimes serve to catalyze creativity in new design work. Unlike
publishers, who must consider the page count (printing costs) of a
book, my publication costs are zero. Instructors may pattern their
lesson plans around the subjects contained in this book series without
being <i>forced</i> to change their plans as the series matures.

</h2>
<b>June 21, 2005</b> -- All volumes except volume 4 have at least minor
corrections, see <a href="log.html">changelog</a>. Volume 3 has a
new <a href="Digital/DIGI_12.html">Shift Registers</a>
Chapter. Spice plots have been replaced by Spice-nutmeg graphic plots,
improving the appearance of volumes 2, and 3. Comming in a couple of
months: AC Motors chapter in Volume 2. Please submit errors, typos, or
suggestions to   All About Circuits > Forums > AllAboutCircuits.com - Feedback and Suggestions <a

<p><b>July 2004 -- IMPORTANT -- PLEASE READ THIS!</b> It has come to my attention
that
I can no longer continue my role as project coordinator and primary
author for this textbook series. My life has simply become too busy,
and I lack the free time necessary to do a good job administrating this
project. See <a href="goodnews.html">goodnews</a> and <a href="badnews.html">badnews</a> for more details.  Fortunately, the open-source nature of this project has led
others to develop it in different directions, where it will continue to
live. The best example of this to date is <a
 href="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com">AllAboutCircuits.com</a>.
Please pay them a visit to see what neat things are being done with the
books.
</p>
<p>
A huge thank-you to Dennis Crunkilton, who bears the distinction of
being the first contributor to submit an entire chapter! Go to <a
 href="Digital/DIGI_8.html">Karnaugh Mapping</a> in Volume IV to see
his fine work.
</p>
<p>
At a reader's suggestion, I made a <a href="log.html">changelog</a>
for all the books. This is a very good idea and I should have done it
long ago! In this changelog, you will find a complete listing of all
the changes made, and when.

<h2>Download the entire collection of books in HTML format</h2>
<a href="liechtml.tar.gz"><img src="src3.jpg" align="middle" border="0">
&lt;--- Click Here!</a>
<p><b>All volumes!</b> HTML code plus graphic images in JPEG format --
about 36 megabytes in size, in .tar.gz format </p>
<!--!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-->

<h2>Download COMPLETE source code for the entire collection of books</h2>
<a href="liecsrc.tar"><img src="src1.jpg" align="middle" border="0">
&lt;--- Click Here!</a>
<p><b>All volumes!</b> One file (liecsrc.tar) containing *src.tar.gz
files for each volume. Each of these gzipped .tar archives contains all
the makefiles, conversion scripts, SubML text source, image libraries,
and graphic images (all formats) needed to compile each volume. About
100 megabytes in its entirety.

<h2>Download MINIMAL source code for the entire collection of books</h2>
<a href="liectiny.tar"><img src="src2.jpg" align="middle" border="0">
&lt;--- Click Here!</a>
<p><b>All volumes!</b> One file (liectiny.tar) containing *tiny.tar.gz
files for each volume. The difference between this source code package
and the one shown above is that this package contains only one format
type for each image (EPS for schematics and illustrations, JPG for
photographs), instead of both formats (EPS <i>and</i> JPG) for all
images. This archive is much smaller (because the omitted EPS
photographic image files are <b>huge</b>!), but requires that you do a
lot of image file conversion to produce either HTML or PostScript/PDF
output. About 8 megabytes in its entirety.

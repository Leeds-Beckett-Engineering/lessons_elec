FOR USERS

Applicability

We assume that you have a Linux/Unix computer system or the equivalent
software running under windows, and that you want to work from the source
files. If you want to modify the text, you need the source files. An 
individual user of .html or .pdf does not need to have the source files,
nor use a Linux/UNIX. Though the  .html, .ps and .pdf certainly can be
generated from the sources.  

If you do not have such facilities, or requirements, you may want to
download liechtml.tar.gz instead for html (htm) for all volumes. If you only
need postscript (.ps) or .pdf you may download the individual volumes from
the corresponding volume web pages. Continue if you want to work with the
sources.

MS Windows users note that the popular WinZip utility is said to be able
to process the .tar and .tar.gz of which we speak below. Use that instead
of the Linux/UNIX based instructions in this document to unzip the
single liechtml.tar.gz, and the individual *.ps.gz for each volume. We
doubt that it is practical to modify the sources on other than a Linux or
Unix sustem.


This document describes: 
    1)Prerequisites
    1)How to generate source files for all volumes from liectiny.tar or 
      liecsrc.tar
    2)How to make html (make html)
    3)How to make everything else  (make all)
	ps    - postscript
        pdf   - adobe portable document format
        LaTex - for publishing a printed book
	ascii - plain text 

Prerequisites
    1) sed - linux text stream editor or Wondows equivalent
    2) LaTeX - texlive-full is a 5Gib package meeting the requirements
       A much smaller assembly of texlive packages needs to be determined
       by the author as an update.


Organization

The top level archive file will un-tar (unpack) into a root directory and
subdirectories for each of the volumes: DC, AC, Semi, Digital, Ref, Exper.
Each of these will initially contain a tar.gz file corresponding to each
volume. The top level directory contains a Makefile target which unzips and
untars the tar.gz's in all five individual volume subdirectories. However,
you must untar the top level .tar file manually. Suppose that you have
downloaded liectiny.tar. Untar it as follows in a direcctory of your
choosing (lessons used here):


	mkdir lessons
	mv liectiny.tar lessons/
	cd lessons
	tar xvf liectiny.tar
	make untarliectinytar


The "tar xvf" command above will give you Makefile, index.htm, various
supporting files and the directories: DC, AC, Semi, Digital, Ref, Exper,
containing one each of the corresponding tar.gz files. The subdirectory
Devel with all files, requiring no further work, will also be present. While
you could sucessively cd to the individual subdirectories, unzip and untar
the tar.gz's, the top level Makefile will do this as described below for
liectiny or liecsrc. Check that you have one tar.gz file in each of the
above five subdirectories, and that Makefile is present in your top
level directory

Then execute "make untarliectinytar" as above to fill the five
subdirectories with the source files corresponding to the individual
tar.gz's. Verify that DC, AC, Semi, Digital, Ref, and Exper are full of
files.

If you are using liectiny.tar, the mogrify command from the ImageMagic
package  must be available on your system to regenerate the .png images 
from .eps images and .eps from .jpg and some .png images. Else, you 
need to use the much larger liecsrc.tar instead of liectiny.tar.



If you have downloaded the larger liecsrc.tar file, untar as follows in a
suitable directory:

	mkdir lessons
	mv liecsrc.tar lessons/
	cd lessons
	tar xvf liecsrc.tar
        make untarliecsrctar

Check for the top level Makefile, and that subdirectories: DC, AC, Semi, Digital,
Ref, and Exper have one tar.gz each. Then make "untarliecsrctar" should
fill these subdirectories with numerous files.

You can now build your target files of choice: "html" or "all" for most
users. If you started with liecsrc.tar, you shoud have everything you need.
If you started with liectiny.tar you will need the mogrify command from the
ImageMagick package. 


Makefile targets


A makefile is included for building the various formats of this document.
Choose a target for use with the make command to generae the file most
appriopriate to you application.

html :

The 'html' option puts together all the pieces necessary to create HTML
output for each volume of the book. However, you need to make the .eps and
.png images first, if starting with liectiny.  It is the default option. The end user
wanting a local copy of the volumes in html use this.  To produce the html
for a local copy from liecsrc, execute the following commands from the top
level directory (lessons in example above):

	make html

If using liectiny as a starting point, make the images first:

	make eps
	make png
	make html


all :

The 'all' option generates HTML and compressed .ps, and .pdf output for all
volumes, and also updates all archive files.  The intent of this option is
for web content providers to be able to simply type 'make all' after
uploading the latest source code and have it produce ALL the files necessary
for users to download. If starting from liecsrc, use this command from the
top level directory:

	make all

If starting with liectiny, use the tinyinstall target below instead of all.



tinyinstall :

The 'tinyinstall' option installs all necessary files from the untarred
'liectiny.tar' archive file. See untarliectiny above for unzipping and
untarring the 'liectiny.tar' archive files in the volume directories prior
to this. Note that the mogrify command from the ImageMagick package must be
available on your system to regenerate the .png images from .eps images and
.eps from .jpg and some .png images. Else, you need to use the liecsrc.tar
instead of liectiny.tar.

	make tinyinstall

If you want to  make a web site which allows the user to download the
liectiny.tar, liecsrc.tar and liechtml.tar as from the top level "Lessons in
Electricity" page, then continue to the next section and make the three
tartets liectiny, liecsrc, and liechtml so that those .tar's will be
generated. Or, if you wish to modify any file, continue to "FOR


CONTRIBUTORS"


FOR CONTRIBUTORS

Don't read this unless you are going to modify or edit the source files
after they have been installed. The liectiny, liecsrc, and liechtml targets
create new liectiny.tar and liecsrc.tar archives rspectively.


liectiny : 

The 'liectiny' option archives the bare minimum set of files 
necessary to reconstruct the entire book.  Image files, while 
duplicated in the directories as both .eps and .jpg formats for 
HTML and TeX/LaTeX/DVI output, respectively, are archived here 
only in their raw source (native) formats: that is, .eps for all
schematics, .eps for tables and equations, .jpg for artwork, and
.jpg for photographs. This .tar file is about 9 Mbyte.
Use this command to create a new liectiny.tar:
	
	make liectiny


liecsrc : 

The 'liecsrc' option archives all source files necessary to reconstruct the
entire book.  This is about 80 Mbytes Use this command to create a new
liecsrc.tar:
	
	make liecsrc


liechtml : 

The 'liechtml' option pieces together only those files necessary for all
volumes of the book to be viewable in HTML format.  No source code is
included (only HTML code) and only JPEG and PNG image formats.  Designed for
the non-contributing reader who just wants a browsable copy on their own
machine.


png : 

The 'png' option creates PNG versions of all illustrations, graphs, and
equations from their respective EPS source files. You migh use this if
you modify the source .eps images to generate the corresponding .png's
required by html.  Before running "make html" on
liecdtiny, run a "make png" Requires 20 minutes on a 500 Mhz P5.

eps : 

The 'eps' option creates Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) versions 
of all photographic images and artwork images from their
respective JPG source files.  If you add or modify .jpg photo's or .png
screen cpature shots, you migh use this. Before running "make html" on
liecdtiny, run a "make png" Requires a few minutes on a 500 Mhz P5.

More notes:

Each of the six individual volume subdirectories contains a Makefile,
which can generate the above for a single volume.  Examine the Makefiles
to determine the names of the targets, or look at the top level 
Makefile for clues. Note that tartets in these individual volume 
subdirectory Makefiles are used by the top level Makefile. 

Any of Tony Kuphaldt's development notes and tutorial are available in the
Devel subdirectory. This shows how to wite or modify source .sml.

The "untarliecsrc" make target will unzip and untar the tar.gz residing in
each of the individual subdirectories after executing tar xvf liecsrc.tar,
which procuces these subdirectories and files. The subdirectories include
AC, DC, Semi, Digital, REf, Exper

The "untarliectiny" make target will unzip and untar the tar.gz residing in
each of the individual subdirectories after executing tar xvf liectiny.tar,
which procuces these subdirectories and files. The subdirectories include

Missing files

The following executable files, which can be downloaded from links on the
top level index.htm page are not included in the tarball as they are third
party, not developed by the authors. If you want the download links on your 
copy to work, you need these.

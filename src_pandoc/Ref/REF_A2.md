## How To Contribute To This Book

As a copylefted work, this book is open to revision and expansion by any interested parties. The only \"catch\" is that credit must be given where credit is due.

If you wish to cite portions of this book in a work of your own, you must follow the same guidelines as for any other copyrighted work. Here is a sample for the CreativeCommons CC BY License:

            You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any
            way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

Given the complexities and security issues surrounding the maintenance of files comprising this book, it is recommended that you submit any revisions or expansions to the original author (Tony R. Kuphaldt). You are, of course, welcome to modify this book directly by editing your own personal copy, but we would all stand to benefit from your contributions if your ideas were incorporated into the online \"master copy\" where all the world can see it.

## _Credits_

All entries arranged in alphabetical order of surname. Major contributions are listed by individual name with some detail on the nature of the contribution(s), date, contact info, etc. Minor contributions (typo corrections, etc.) are listed by name only for reasons of brevity. Please understand that when I classify a contribution as \"minor,\" it is in no way inferior to the effort or value of a \"major\" contribution, just smaller in the sense of less text changed. Any and all contributions are gratefully accepted. I am indebted to all those who have given freely of their own knowledge, time, and resources to make this a better book!

# Edited Versions of Electric Circuits

## Overview

This folder contains an edited version of the full [_Lessons In Electric Circuits_](https://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/)) by Tony R. Kuphaldt. Most of the edits are selections, or reorganisations, aimed at making it easier to incorporate this material into the module structure at Leeds Beckett. In all cases the changelog below, and in the individual chapters, should be retained.

**NOTE**: All changes which add or change the original material should be backported to at least the ['`src_pandoc`'](../src_pandoc) material: but ideally to the ['`src`'](../src). This is to comply with the original licence, and collaborative spirit of the original, so that all changes can be incorporated into the official versions. As such, all sources are made available under the terms of the '['`LICENSE`'](../LICENSE.md), and as follows

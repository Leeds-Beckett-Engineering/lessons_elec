abstract: |
  This third volume of the book series _Lessons In Electric Circuits_ makes a departure from the former two in that 
  the transition between _electric_ circuits and _electronic_ circuits is formally crossed. Electric circuits are 
  connections of conductive wires and other devices whereby the uniform flow of electrons occurs. Electronic 
  circuits add a new dimension to electric circuits in that some means of _control_ is exerted over the flow of 
  electrons by another electrical signal, either a voltage or a current.

## From Electric to Electronic{ #sec:xtocid15698970 }

This third volume of the book series _Lessons In Electric Circuits_ makes a departure from the former two in that the transition between _electric_ circuits and _electronic_ circuits is formally crossed. Electric circuits are connections of conductive wires and other devices whereby the uniform flow of electrons occurs. Electronic circuits add a new dimension to electric circuits in that some means of _control_ is exerted over the flow of electrons by another electrical signal, either a voltage or a current.

In and of itself, the control of electron flow is nothing new to the student of electric circuits. Switches control the flow of electrons, as do potentiometers, especially when connected as variable resistors (rheostats). Neither the switch nor the potentiometer should be new to your experience by this point in your study. The threshold marking the transition from electric to electronic, then, is defined by _how_ the flow of electrons is controlled rather than whether or not any form of control exists in a circuit. Switches and rheostats control the flow of electrons according to the positioning of a mechanical device, which is actuated by some physical force external to the circuit. In electronics, however, we are dealing with special devices able to control the flow of electrons according to another flow of electrons, or by the application of a static voltage. In other words, in an electronic circuit, _electricity is able to control electricity_.

The historic precursor to the modern electronics era was invented by Thomas Edison in 1880 while developing the electric incandescent lamp. Edison found that a small current passed from the heated lamp filament to a metal plate mounted inside the vacuum envelop. (@fig:03375 (a)) Today this is known as the "Edison effect". Note that the battery is only necessary to heat the filament. Electrons would still flow if a non-electrical heat source was used.

By 1904 Marconi Wireless Company adviser John Flemming found that an externally applied current (plate battery) only passed in one direction from filament to plate (@fig:03375 (b)), but not the reverse direction (not shown). This invention was the vacuum diode, used to convert alternating currents to DC. The addition of a third electrode by Lee DeForest (@fig:03375 (c)) allowed a small signal to control the larger electron flow from filament to plate.

Historically, the era of electronics began with the invention of the _Audion tube_, a device controlling the flow of an electron stream through a vacuum by the application of a small voltage between two metal structures within the tube. A more detailed summary of so-called _electron tube_ or _vacuum tube_ technology is available in the last chapter of this volume for those who are interested.

Electronics technology experienced a revolution in 1948 with the invention of the _transistor_. This tiny device achieved approximately the same effect as the Audion tube, but in a vastly smaller amount of space and with less material. Transistors control the flow of electrons through solid _semiconductor_ substances rather than through a vacuum, and so transistor technology is often referred to as _solid-state_ electronics.

## Active versus Passive Devices{ #sec:xtocid15698971 }

An _active_ device is any type of circuit component with the ability to electrically control electron flow (electricity controlling electricity). In order for a circuit to be properly called _electronic_, it must contain at least one active device. Components incapable of controlling current by means of another electrical signal are called _passive_ devices. Resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers, and even diodes are all considered passive devices. Active devices include, but are not limited to, vacuum tubes, transistors, silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs), and TRIACs. A case might be made for the saturable reactor to be defined as an active device, since it is able to control an AC current with a DC current, but I\'ve never heard it referred to as such. The operation of each of these active devices will be explored in later chapters of this volume.

All active devices control the flow of electrons through them. Some active devices allow a voltage to control this current while other active devices allow another current to do the job. Devices utilizing a static voltage as the controlling signal are, not surprisingly, called _voltage-controlled_ devices. Devices working on the principle of one current controlling another current are known as _current-controlled_ devices. For the record, vacuum tubes are voltage-controlled devices while transistors are made as either voltage-controlled or current controlled types. The first type of transistor successfully demonstrated was a current-controlled device.
